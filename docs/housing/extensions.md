# Extensions

Extending your reservation is easy.

1. Log in to Enkor Stay.

2. Go to `My Account` and select `My Bookings`

3. Click the `Extend` button under `Stays`.

4. If you would like to check the possibility of an extension, please contact the host!

### Do I need to pay the Enkor service fee again, if I wish to extend my stay?

We treat extension reservations as separate bookings.

Therefore, when extending your reservation, the amount excluding the check-out cleaning fee will be charged again.
