### What is installment payment (monthly payment)

Installment payment is a method where the rent is divided and automatically paid on the 1st of each month when residing for more than 3 months (90 nights).

For extended stays exceeding 60 nights, you have the option to choose installment payments.

### I chose installment payment, but the initial payment is too expensive!

During the first installment payment, all fees and management costs are charged, and <u>the rent from the move-in date to the end of the following month is billed together</u>, which may make the initial payment relatively high.

However, from the next installment onwards, only the rent will be charged, so you don't need to worry!

### What is a lump-sum payment?

Lump-sum payment option is a method of paying all rent and management fees for the reservation during booking.

### Can I pay with debit?

Yes, it is possible.

However, please be aware that there may be cases where the payment cannot be processed due to insufficient funds caused by exchange rates OR daily limits in payment.
So please check the exchange rate and balance before making the payment!

### How can I check my receipt?

Once the payment is completed, a receipt will be sent to the email address you provided during the payment.

Please check your inbox or spam folder.
