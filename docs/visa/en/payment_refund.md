# Payment and refund

### What if there is a payment error?

There might be many reasons why payment does not work.

1.  Check your primary debit/credit card is working.

2.  Some debit/credit cards have credit limits. Please check if you've not reached that limit.

3.  Some debit/credit cards do not support overseas payment. Check if card is available to use overseas.
