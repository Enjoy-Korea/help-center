<p>The purpose of these terms and conditions is to define the rights, obligations, and other necessary matters between Enkor With Us Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Company&quot;) and the &quot;Host&quot; in relation to the use of services provided by the &quot;Company&quot; through &#x27;enkorstay&#x27; (<a href="https://stay.enkor.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stay.enkor.kr/</a>) and the Host webpage (<a href="https://host.enkor.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://host.enkor.kr/</a>) (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Service&quot;).</p>
<h1><strong>Definitions</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>Host General Terms</strong></h1>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-3">Article 3<a href="#article-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 3" title="Direct link to Article 3">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Company&quot; acts as a communication sales intermediary, facilitating direct transactions between &quot;Hosts&quot; and &quot;Guests.&quot; Therefore, the &quot;Company&quot; is not primarily involved in disputes that arise between &quot;Guests&quot; and &quot;Hosts.&quot; However, if it is difficult to resolve disputes between the &quot;Guest&quot; and &quot;Host,&quot; the &quot;Company&quot; acts as a mediator, with the priority being an agreement between the two parties. The &quot;Company&quot; also provides various services required for contracts between the &quot;Guest&quot; and &quot;Host&quot; and may charge usage fees (information service fees) according to its internal policy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-4">Article 4<a href="#article-4" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 4" title="Direct link to Article 4">​</a></h3>
<p>All payments between the &quot;Host&quot; and &quot;Guest&quot; must be made through the &quot;Company&quot; platform, and upon payment, the contract for the space and usage period is deemed to have been established between the two members. If a direct transaction occurs without going through the platform, the &quot;Company&quot; may restrict access to the &quot;Service.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-5">Article 5<a href="#article-5" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 5" title="Direct link to Article 5">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Host&quot; must process cancellations and refunds for &quot;Guests&quot; who made payments through the &quot;Service&quot; according to the &quot;Company&quot; policy and the cancellation and refund policy notified to the &quot;Guest&quot; by the &quot;Company.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-6">Article 6<a href="#article-6" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 6" title="Direct link to Article 6">​</a></h3>
<p>If the &quot;Host&quot; fails to comply with exceptional regulations, cancellations and refunds will be handled according to the basic policy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-7">Article 7<a href="#article-7" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 7" title="Direct link to Article 7">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Host&quot; may not use the personal information of &quot;Guests&quot; acquired through the use of the &quot;Service&quot; for purposes other than those defined in the &quot;Company&quot; terms. If violated, the &quot;Host&quot; assumes all legal responsibilities under civil and criminal law and must indemnify the &quot;Company&quot; at their own expense and effort. The &quot;Company&quot; may terminate all contracts with the &quot;Host.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-8">Article 8<a href="#article-8" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 8" title="Direct link to Article 8">​</a></h3>
<p>If the &quot;Host&quot; cancels a confirmed reservation (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Host Cancellation&quot;), preventing the &quot;Guest&quot; from using the reserved space, the &quot;Host&quot; is responsible for refunds and compensation to the &quot;Guest&quot; and any other complaints that arise. The &quot;Host&quot; will also be charged a cancellation fee.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-9">Article 9<a href="#article-9" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 9" title="Direct link to Article 9">​</a></h3>
<p>If the &quot;Guest&quot; cancels the reservation within the allowable time frame without incurring any fees, even after the &quot;Host&quot; has confirmed the reservation, the &quot;Host&quot; must handle the cancellation without any penalties. The &quot;Company&quot; will refund the full payment to the &quot;Guest.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-10">Article 10<a href="#article-10" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 10" title="Direct link to Article 10">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Host&quot; and the &quot;Guest&quot; may create a separate contract by mutual agreement, but if a dispute arises that needs resolution, refunds and adjustments will be made according to the &quot;Company&quot; refund policy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-11">Article 11<a href="#article-11" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 11" title="Direct link to Article 11">​</a></h3>
<p>Abnormal transactions that conflict with the purpose of the &quot;Company&quot; policies, including fraudulent methods or schemes (collectively referred to as &quot;Fraudulent Acts&quot;), are strictly prohibited. If the &quot;Host&quot; is suspected of such fraudulent acts, the &quot;Company&quot; may request an explanation from the &quot;Host,&quot; and the &quot;Host&quot; must comply. If it is determined that the &quot;Host&quot; gained financial benefit or caused another party to gain benefit through fraudulent acts, the &quot;Company&quot; may recover the financial gain and may claim damages or deduct compensation from settlement payments. Additionally, the &quot;Host&quot; may be excluded from benefits provided by the &quot;Company&quot; (e.g., increased exposure to customers), and in severe cases, the &quot;Host&quot; account may be suspended.</p>
<h1><strong>Host Responsibilities and Obligations</strong></h1>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-12">Article 12<a href="#article-12" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 12" title="Direct link to Article 12">​</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Host&quot; must actively communicate with the &quot;Guest&quot; if any issues arise during the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; stay.</p>
<p>The &quot;Host&quot; and &quot;Guest&quot; must mutually respect each other, and the &quot;Host&quot; is responsible for providing a suitable accommodation for the &quot;Guest.&quot; Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrimination based on the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; race, nationality, or gender is not permitted.</li>
<li>The information about the space must match the actual location and interior, and the provided options should not differ. If options differ, the &quot;Guest&quot; must be informed and consent obtained in advance.</li>
<li>The &quot;Host&quot; must not use third-party platforms or suggest transactions through other platforms in the information or messages provided without the &quot;Company&#x27;s&quot; approval.</li>
<li>The &quot;Host&quot; must provide a level of management that meets at least the minimum management standards. Examples include:<!-- -->

<li>Trash bins are not emptied.</li>
<li>The accommodation is in a condition where it is difficult to enter due to the filth, as determined by the &quot;Company.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>※ The &quot;Host&quot; is obligated to comply with these rules, and if the &quot;Host&quot; fails to do so, the &quot;Guest&quot; will not be held responsible.</p>
<h1><strong>Host Penalties and Other Fees</strong></h1>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-13">Article 13<a href="#article-13" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article 13" title="Direct link to Article 13">​</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; obligations, the &quot;Host&quot; also has the responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable accommodation for the &quot;Guest.&quot; In some cases, penalties or other fees may be imposed on the &quot;Host.&quot;</p>
<p>Host penalties are separate from refunds and are compensation amounts payable to the &quot;Guest,&quot; while the fees are paid to the &quot;Company&quot; to restore the platform&#x27;s credibility, which may have been damaged by the &quot;Host&#x27;s&quot; actions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conditions-for-compensation-to-guests"><strong>Conditions for Compensation to Guests</strong><a href="#conditions-for-compensation-to-guests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to conditions-for-compensation-to-guests" title="Direct link to conditions-for-compensation-to-guests">​</a></h2>

<p>The &quot;Guest&quot; may receive compensation from the &quot;Host&quot; under the following conditions, and the &quot;Host&quot; must respond to cancellation or compensation requests from the &quot;Guest.&quot;</p>
<p>For other inconveniences (e.g., noise), the &quot;Host&quot; must communicate directly with the &quot;Guest&quot; and make an effort to resolve the issue. If resolution is difficult, the &quot;Host&quot; can request the &quot;Company&quot; to act as a mediator (refer to Article 17 for the guest compensation process).</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="14-1-cancellation-by-the-host-partial-refund">14-1 Cancellation by the Host (Partial Refund)<a href="#14-1-cancellation-by-the-host-partial-refund" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 14-1 Cancellation by the Host (Partial Refund)" title="Direct link to 14-1 Cancellation by the Host (Partial Refund)">​</a></h4>
<p>This refers to cases where the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; reservation has been confirmed by the &quot;Host,&quot; but the reservation is unilaterally canceled by the &quot;Host.&quot; This is strictly distinguished from reservation rejection, and in cases where the cancellation is due to uncontrollable reasons, penalties and fees may be mitigated. Host-caused cancellations are classified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Controllable Reasons</strong><br>
<!-- -->These include situations caused by the &quot;Host&#x27;s&quot; intent or negligence, or when evidence is provided, but its credibility is low.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-booking by the &quot;Host.&quot;</li>
<li>Change of mind by the &quot;Host.&quot;</li>
<li>Expiration of the rental contract.</li>
<li>Mechanical breakdowns (electricity, heating, etc.).<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If proof is submitted that the breakdown occurred unexpectedly, penalties and fees may be mitigated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncontrollable Reasons</strong><br>
<!-- -->These include situations where the &quot;Host&#x27;s&quot; intent or negligence is excluded, and credible evidence is provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural disasters, war.</li>
<li>Fire or destruction of the building.</li>
<li>Rental not possible due to government restrictions (e.g., due to infectious diseases).</li>
<li>Death of the &quot;Host.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>If the information about the space differs from what was provided at the time of reservation, and the &quot;Guest&quot; did not agree to these changes, compensation will be provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Options provided with the space are different from what was promised.</li>

<p>Although poor management does not directly qualify for a refund, it is subject to complaints. The &quot;Host&quot; must provide a space that meets the minimum management standards, and if poor management is confirmed, the &quot;Host&quot; must make all efforts to improve the situation. Examples of poor management include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Belongings of the previous &quot;Guest&quot; left behind.</li>
<li>Missing amenities promised to the &quot;Guest&quot; (e.g., vacuum cleaner, kitchen utensils).</li>
<li>Malfunction of devices that affect the quality of the living environment promised by the &quot;Host.&quot;</li>
<li>Presence of harmful elements (e.g., mold, mites) that could affect the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; health.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Proof from a recognized organization or institution must be submitted to the &quot;Host&quot; to show that these elements are a threat to the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; health.</li>
<li>Normal issues like hair found in the space after cleaning or seasonal insects (e.g., mosquitoes) do not count as harmful elements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Both the &quot;Host&quot; and the &quot;Guest&quot; must be aware of the poor management situation.</li>
<li>The &quot;Guest&quot; must wait for the &quot;Host&quot; to make efforts to improve the poor condition.</li>
<li>The &quot;Host&quot; must actively resolve the issues of poor management reported by the &quot;Guest.&quot;</li>
<li>If the &quot;Host&quot; finds it difficult to improve the situation, they may offer the &quot;Guest&quot; another accommodation, upgrade the accommodation, or lower the rental fee.</li>

<p>Host penalties refer to the compensation amounts payable to the &quot;Guest&quot; in addition to a full refund when issues specified in Article 14 arise.</p>
<p>The primary focus is a mutual agreement between the &quot;Host&quot; and &quot;Guest,&quot; and if the situation is unresolved despite mediation efforts by the &quot;Company,&quot; the penalties will be applied, with priority given to the &quot;Guest&#x27;s&quot; request.</p>

<p>If the &quot;Host&quot; cancels a reservation without justifiable reason, the following penalties will be applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>_Penalty: Total rental fee _ 10%_</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the cancellation is due to uncontrollable reasons (e.g., epidemic, natural disaster), the penalty is reduced by 50%, with the detailed rates as follows:</p>
<ol>
