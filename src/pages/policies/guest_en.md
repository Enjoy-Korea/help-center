## 2. **Rent Calculation**

### **Calculation Method for Rent**

- Rent is determined based on the number of nights a tenant resides and sleeps.
- The minimum booking requirement for initial new agreements is 30 nights.
- Monthly rent is applied when the tenant sleeps throughout the entire month.
- If the tenant sleeps for only a part of the month, the daily rent is determined by multiplying it by the number of nights.
  - Daily rent = Monthly rent / 30
- **Example**
  1. 2023.01.01 ~ 2023.01.31 (30 nights):
  - Daily rent for partial stay in January \* 30 nights
  1. 2023.01.01 ~ 2023.02.01 (31 nights):
  - Full monthly rent charged for the entire stay in January.
  1. 2023.01.15 ~ 2023.02.14 (30 nights):
  - Daily rent for partial stay in January and February \* 30 nights
  1. 2023.01.15 ~ 2023.04.14 (90 nights):
  - For January and April, the rent is calculated based on daily rates due to partial stay, whereas for February and March, it's calculated with the full monthly rate due to complete occupancy.

## **3. Agreement & Cancellation Refunds**

  1. Membership registration (Log in)
  2. Selection of the accommodation and choosing the period of use
  3. Tenant payment process
  4. Sending an agreement approval request to the host
  5. Approval of the host's request

- Upon completion of payment and agreement, the tenant is deemed to have fully understood and agreed to these terms and conditions, the service details, the conditions for the host's accommodation, and the refund policy.
- The company provides the necessary services for the execution of contracts between tenants and hosts and may impose service fees according to its internal policies during the contract process between tenants and hosts.

### **Agreement application**

Tenants can choose their preferred stay(accomodation), dates, and the number of people at [**stay.enkor.kr**](http://stay.enkor.kr/).

If the actual rental information is different from the agreed one, except when the rental information has changed since the time of agreement, and the 'tenant' has agreed to it. The provided rental option information is different from the actual situation. Building location information is different from the actual.

**Not Eligible for Tenant Refund Request** If the tenant fails to fulfill their obligations, however, the host must provide evidence that the tenant did not fulfill their obligations. Reasons not listed in the contract written by the tenant for refunds. Loss of valuables or items owned by the tenant due to their own fault.

### **※ Note ※**

**1) Poor Rental Management**

- Poor rental management can be subject to complaints, but it's not directly eligible for refunds.
- However, the host is obligated to provide accommodations that meet or exceed the minimum maintenance standards. If subpar rental conditions are identified, all efforts must be made to rectify them.
- Examples of poor rental management include:
  - Previous tenant's belongings left unattended.
  - Failure to provide features specified for the tenant (e.g., vacuum cleaner, kitchen utensils).
  - Malfunction of devices promised by the host affecting a comfortable living environment.
- Failure to remove elements that can pose health risks to tenants (e.g., mold, mites).
  - Proof from a reputable organization or institution confirming that these elements posed a threat to the tenant's health must be provided.
  - Stray hairs that could be found even after room inspection and cleaning, or seasonal insects (like mosquitoes) that can appear during specific periods, are not considered under this.

**2) In the event of poor rental management**

- Both the host and tenant should be cognizant of the compromised rental conditions.
- Tenants should await the host's efforts to ameliorate these conditions.
- The host must actively take measures to address and correct any rental issues raised by the tenant.
- If the host assesses that it's no longer feasible to further enhance the rental conditions, they can offer options to the tenant, such as relocating to another of the host's properties, upgrading the accommodation grade, or providing discounts on the monthly rent or living expenses.

### **Tenant Refund Procedure**

The refund procedure for the tenant is: 1) Evidence collection, 2) Bilateral negotiation, 3) Customer service mediation request, 4) Refund progression.

1. Evidence collection
   - Sufficient evidence, like photos and videos, should be collected within 24 hours of the issue occurrence.
   - If necessary, the host can request additional documentation or materials from the tenant.
2. Bilateral negotiation
   - Tenants can request a refund from the host based on collected evidence.
   - The host can compensate the tenant through means other than a refund.
   - If a satisfactory agreement isn't reached, they can proceed to the next step.
3. Customer service mediation request
   - If mediation is requested at the Enkor customer center, mediation will be provided within a maximum of 3 business days.
   - Enkor customer service follows the basic terms and cancellation refund regulations and mediates based on them.
   - However, if there's evidence from the host of issues caused by the tenant, like smoking or bringing unauthorized pets, a refund might be challenging.
   - The total refund amount a tenant can receive cannot exceed the actual rent paid by the tenant, and no compensation will be provided for any special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from or related to the host's failure to fulfill their obligations.

### **Time required for a refund**

1. Refund requests reported within 24 hours of the issue occurrence are deemed more reliable.
2. If refund conditions are met, the refund amount will be automatically received within 10 days or sooner.
3. Enkorwithus processes payments and refunds through Stripe. Even after initiating the refund, the actual time for the refunded amount to reflect in the bank account can vary based on the bank and card company's processing times.

### Limit of Compensation

1. Definition of Direct and Indirect Damage
   - **Direct Damage**: This refers to the responsibility of the Host for damages caused by failing to fulfill essential contractual obligations to the Tenant. In such cases, compensation is provided for actual, direct damages resulting from these unmet obligations.
   - **Indirect/Special Damage**: This refers to damages that are not directly tied to the main obligations of the contract between the host and tenant but may arise additionally. Such damages fall outside the core purpose of the contract and are generally not eligible for compensation.
2. Compensation for Each Type of Damage
   - **Eligibility for Direct Damages**
     Direct damages resulting from a failure to fulfill primary obligations to the Tenant may be eligible for compensation. However, compensation will be limited to reasonable, comparable alternatives rather than luxury or premium options.
     - If the tenant must find alternative rent house due to an issue with the property, compensation will cover costs up to a level similar to the original accommodation.
     - Additional costs directly related to a loss of accommodation, such as reasonable travel fees or essential replacement items, may also be considered for compensation within reasonable limits, subject to prior discussion with the host.
   - **No Responsibility for Special or Indirect Damages**
     Compensation generally does not extend to unexpected or additional costs or losses that may arise from content provided or unmet obligations by the Host.
     - If a rental issue results in lost mobile data, missed meetings, or the need to purchase items not provided by the Host, these situations are typically not eligible for compensation.
3. Limitation of Total Responsibility
   - For all matters related to the contract with the tenant, responsibility is limited to actual, direct damages only. This means that any compensation claims shall not exceed the amount required to cover direct damages resulting directly from unmet contractual obligations. Indirect or incidental damages are excluded from this responsibility, ensuring that liability is strictly tied to direct impacts.

  - If damage is confirmed, the host issues an invoice to the tenant responsible for the damage.
  - If there are objections to the amount, the tenant must communicate their objections to the host within 24 hours after receiving the invoice.
  - Failure to raise objections within the given time frame will be considered agreement to the invoice, and the cost will be billed accordingly.

## **7. Review**

- The review system is comprised of tenant feedback on rentals and responses from hosts. The purpose of this policy is to mutually respect and balance the rights of tenants and hosts, providing protection.
- Tenants can write reviews within 3 days before the move-out date, and hosts have the option to respond to the comments left by tenants.

- Reviews containing the following characteristics will be subject to unnotified deletion after administrator verification:
  1. Explicit sexual expressions or profanity
