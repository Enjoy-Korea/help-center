# **Host General Terms**

### Article 3

The "Company" acts as a communication sales intermediary, facilitating direct transactions between "Hosts" and "Guests." Therefore, the "Company" is not primarily involved in disputes that arise between "Guests" and "Hosts." However, if it is difficult to resolve disputes between the "Guest" and "Host," the "Company" acts as a mediator, with the priority being an agreement between the two parties. The "Company" also provides various services required for contracts between the "Guest" and "Host" and may charge usage fees (information service fees) according to its internal policy.

### Article 4

All payments between the "Host" and "Guest" must be made through the "Company" platform, and upon payment, the contract for the space and usage period is deemed to have been established between the two members. If a direct transaction occurs without going through the platform, the "Company" may restrict access to the "Service."

### Article 5

The "Host" must process cancellations and refunds for "Guests" who made payments through the "Service" according to the "Company" policy and the cancellation and refund policy notified to the "Guest" by the "Company."

### Article 6

If the "Host" fails to comply with exceptional regulations, cancellations and refunds will be handled according to the basic policy.

### Article 7

The "Host" may not use the personal information of "Guests" acquired through the use of the "Service" for purposes other than those defined in the "Company" terms. If violated, the "Host" assumes all legal responsibilities under civil and criminal law and must indemnify the "Company" at their own expense and effort. The "Company" may terminate all contracts with the "Host."

### Article 8

If the "Host" cancels a confirmed reservation (hereinafter referred to as "Host Cancellation"), preventing the "Guest" from using the reserved space, the "Host" is responsible for refunds and compensation to the "Guest" and any other complaints that arise. The "Host" will also be charged a cancellation fee.

### Article 9

If the "Guest" cancels the reservation within the allowable time frame without incurring any fees, even after the "Host" has confirmed the reservation, the "Host" must handle the cancellation without any penalties. The "Company" will refund the full payment to the "Guest."

### Article 10

The "Host" and the "Guest" may create a separate contract by mutual agreement, but if a dispute arises that needs resolution, refunds and adjustments will be made according to the "Company" refund policy.

### Article 11

Abnormal transactions that conflict with the purpose of the "Company" policies, including fraudulent methods or schemes (collectively referred to as "Fraudulent Acts"), are strictly prohibited. If the "Host" is suspected of such fraudulent acts, the "Company" may request an explanation from the "Host," and the "Host" must comply. If it is determined that the "Host" gained financial benefit or caused another party to gain benefit through fraudulent acts, the "Company" may recover the financial gain and may claim damages or deduct compensation from settlement payments. Additionally, the "Host" may be excluded from benefits provided by the "Company" (e.g., increased exposure to customers), and in severe cases, the "Host" account may be suspended.

# **Host Responsibilities and Obligations**

### Article 12

The "Host" must actively communicate with the "Guest" if any issues arise during the "Guest's" stay.

The "Host" and "Guest" must mutually respect each other, and the "Host" is responsible for providing a suitable accommodation for the "Guest." Examples include:

- Discrimination based on the "Guest's" race, nationality, or gender is not permitted.
- The information about the space must match the actual location and interior, and the provided options should not differ. If options differ, the "Guest" must be informed and consent obtained in advance.
- The "Host" must not use third-party platforms or suggest transactions through other platforms in the information or messages provided without the "Company's" approval.
- The "Host" must provide a level of management that meets at least the minimum management standards. Examples include:
  - The previous tenant's belongings are left in the space.
  - Trash bins are not emptied.
  - The accommodation is in a condition where it is difficult to enter due to the filth, as determined by the "Company."

※ The "Host" is obligated to comply with these rules, and if the "Host" fails to do so, the "Guest" will not be held responsible.

# **Host Penalties and Other Fees**

### Article 13

In addition to the "Guest's" obligations, the "Host" also has the responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable accommodation for the "Guest." In some cases, penalties or other fees may be imposed on the "Host."

Host penalties are separate from refunds and are compensation amounts payable to the "Guest," while the fees are paid to the "Company" to restore the platform's credibility, which may have been damaged by the "Host's" actions.

## **Conditions for Compensation to Guests**

### Article 14

The "Guest" may receive compensation from the "Host" under the following conditions, and the "Host" must respond to cancellation or compensation requests from the "Guest."

For other inconveniences (e.g., noise), the "Host" must communicate directly with the "Guest" and make an effort to resolve the issue. If resolution is difficult, the "Host" can request the "Company" to act as a mediator (refer to Article 17 for the guest compensation process).

#### 14-1 Cancellation by the Host (Partial Refund)

This refers to cases where the "Guest's" reservation has been confirmed by the "Host," but the reservation is unilaterally canceled by the "Host." This is strictly distinguished from reservation rejection, and in cases where the cancellation is due to uncontrollable reasons, penalties and fees may be mitigated. Host-caused cancellations are classified as follows:

1. **Controllable Reasons**  
   These include situations caused by the "Host's" intent or negligence, or when evidence is provided, but its credibility is low.

   - Double-booking by the "Host."
   - Change of mind by the "Host."
   - Expiration of the rental contract.
   - Mechanical breakdowns (electricity, heating, etc.).
     - If proof is submitted that the breakdown occurred unexpectedly, penalties and fees may be mitigated.

2. **Uncontrollable Reasons**  
   These include situations where the "Host's" intent or negligence is excluded, and credible evidence is provided.
   - Natural disasters, war.
   - Fire or destruction of the building.
   - Rental not possible due to government restrictions (e.g., due to infectious diseases).
   - Death of the "Host."

#### 14-2 Information Mismatch

If the information about the space differs from what was provided at the time of reservation, and the "Guest" did not agree to these changes, compensation will be provided.

- Options provided with the space are different from what was promised.
- The location information of the building is incorrect.

#### 14-3 Poor Management of the Space

Although poor management does not directly qualify for a refund, it is subject to complaints. The "Host" must provide a space that meets the minimum management standards, and if poor management is confirmed, the "Host" must make all efforts to improve the situation. Examples of poor management include:

- Belongings of the previous "Guest" left behind.
- Missing amenities promised to the "Guest" (e.g., vacuum cleaner, kitchen utensils).
- Malfunction of devices that affect the quality of the living environment promised by the "Host."
- Presence of harmful elements (e.g., mold, mites) that could affect the "Guest's" health.
  - Proof from a recognized organization or institution must be submitted to the "Host" to show that these elements are a threat to the "Guest's" health.
  - Normal issues like hair found in the space after cleaning or seasonal insects (e.g., mosquitoes) do not count as harmful elements.

#### 14-4 Steps for Handling Poor Management

- Both the "Host" and the "Guest" must be aware of the poor management situation.
- The "Guest" must wait for the "Host" to make efforts to improve the poor condition.
- The "Host" must actively resolve the issues of poor management reported by the "Guest."
- If the "Host" finds it difficult to improve the situation, they may offer the "Guest" another accommodation, upgrade the accommodation, or lower the rental fee.

## **Host Penalties**

### Article 15

Host penalties refer to the compensation amounts payable to the "Guest" in addition to a full refund when issues specified in Article 14 arise.

The primary focus is a mutual agreement between the "Host" and "Guest," and if the situation is unresolved despite mediation efforts by the "Company," the penalties will be applied, with priority given to the "Guest's" request.

#### 15-1 Host-Caused Cancellations

If the "Host" cancels a reservation without justifiable reason, the following penalties will be applied:

- **_Penalty: Total rental fee _ 10%\_**

However, if the cancellation is due to uncontrollable reasons (e.g., epidemic, natural disaster), the penalty is reduced by 50%, with the detailed rates as follows:

1. Cancellation 61 days or more before check-in: 5%
2. Cancellation 60–31 days before check-in: 7%
3. Cancellation 30–8 days before check-in: 10%
4. Cancellation within 7 days before check-in: 15%
5. Cancellation within 3 days before check-in: 20%

#### 15-2 Mismatch in Information

If the space information differs from the reservation details, and the "Guest" did not consent to the changes, the "Host" must notify the "Guest" as soon as possible before check-in. If this obligation is not fulfilled, a penalty may be imposed by the "Company."

## **Payment Processing Fees**

### Article 16

The payment processing fee is an amount paid to the "Company" to restore the platform's credibility after a cancellation by the "Host." It is deducted during settlement and paid to the "Company." The same fee applies to all reservations, and if damage occurs to the "Guest" due to the "Host's" fault, this fee will be deducted from the settlement amount.

- **_Fee: 10% of the guest's payment amount_**

If evidence for uncontrollable reasons is submitted within five business days, a 50% reduction will be applied.

- If evidence of the "Guest's" violation (e.g., smoking, bringing in pets) is provided by the "Host," the "Guest" may not be eligible for compensation.

#### 17-4 Proceeding with Compensation

- If compensation is required, the "Company" will prepay the compensation to the "Guest" and deduct the amount from the settlement due to the "Host."
- If the "Guest" must compensate the "Host," the "Host" must share a copy of the compensation receipt with the "Company."

# **Host Settlement**

- **Monthly Rent**: Rent is settled on the 10th of each month for rent payments made by the "Guest" on the 1st of the month.

#### 18-2 Deduction from Settlement

If penalties or other fees occur, they will be deducted during the settlement process. If the amount to be deducted exceeds the settlement amount, the settlement payment will be withheld, and the deduction will be applied to the next settlement.

If the "Host" intends to stop their activities and withdraw from membership, settlement will be arranged by agreement with the "Company."

#### 18-3 Deferred Settlement Payments

If the "Guest" does not pay the rent, the settlement amount will not include unpaid rent, and settlement payments will not be made on the 10th. If the "Guest" pays the rent after the regular settlement date, the payment will be made to the "Host" within three business days.
