# Terms of Service

## 1. Definitions

These Terms of Use (hereinafter referred to as the "**Terms**") govern the EnkorStay website and application operated by EnkorWithUs, a registered legal entity in Korea. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between EnkorStay (hereinafter referred to as "**we**," "**us**," "**our**," or "**Company**") and users accessing and using the services provided on the EnkorStay platform, including those provided by third-party operators (hereinafter "**Host**" or "**Operator**"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the services.

The EnkorStay platform provides an online space for users to post, offer, search, and book services. Members offering services are referred to as "**Hosts**" or "**Operators**," while members booking and using services are "**Guests**." Hosts may provide accommodations ("**Accommodations**"), activities, tours, events ("**Experiences**"), visa or ARC services ("**Visa Services**"), and other travel-related services (collectively, "**Host Services**"). To access various features of the platform, users must register an account and maintain accurate account information.

As the platform provider, EnkorStay does not own, control, or manage any Host Services and disclaims any responsibility for damages related to those services. EnkorStay does not act as a real estate agent or insurer, and it is not a party to agreements between Hosts and Guests. The Host is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and agreements with third parties concerning the services they provide.
